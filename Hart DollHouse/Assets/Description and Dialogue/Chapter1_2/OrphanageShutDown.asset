  - "RIDGETOWN TIMES \n28 SEPT --\n\n-- Sanctuary, a private orphanage -- outskirts
    of Ridgetown, -- shut down on 28th --\n\n-- 2 months before by -- on night patrol,
    the orphanage was home to 107 children, 25 of which had disappeared rapidly under
    unnatural circumstances. The police was alerted by the screaming of a child, and
    upon searching the premises, found evidence of unethical testing. \n\nNow, after
    extensive investigation, the orphanage was found to been collaborating with pharmaceutical
    companies by providing their children as volunteer subject without the children
    knowledge."
